    "A predictive question is where a certain class or a specific numerical value of a future observation is estimated using data that already exists. To predict the usage of a video game server, specifically to predict a playerâ€™s hours playing the game, we are going to use a method called regression using the k-nearest neighbors model. Regression is a method used to predict a quantitative value for our future observations. Since we are using the k-nearest neighbors model, we take the average number of neighbors close to each value of the predictor and make a curve that fits the total observations. This curve contains the average location of all the points close to the predictor value thus we can predict the numerical value of our future observation. \n"
